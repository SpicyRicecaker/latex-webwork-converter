Powered by [`svelte`](https://svelte.dev/). The majority of the code here is from unrelated skeleton code lol.

See `reference.py` for the reference Python implementation, and `src/routes/+page.svelte` for the Javascript implementation.

Colors in this website are from the color theme [`gruvbox-material`](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material) by [`@sainnhe`](https://github.com/sainnhe). Please check it out! It's one of my favorite color themes of all time!
